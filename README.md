Hi,

Welcome to my Portfolio!

The portfolio is a website and these are the source files for it contained in "software-product-sprint/portfolio/src"

This portfolio is meant to be deployed on an appengine.
To run it locally:
-Go to into the directory: software-product-sprint/portfolio
-run: mvn package appengine:run

  If it's running properly, there should be a link in the terminal that opens it locally.

To deploy it online:
-Go to into the directory: software-product-sprint/portfolio
-run: mvn package appengine:deploy

  If it's running properly, there should be a link in the terminal that opens the website online.
